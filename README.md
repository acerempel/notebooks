# Good evening!

This is going to be a web app for writing text documents. These documents shall have the structure of prose, may
have formatting of various kinds applied, shall be able to be organized and linked to one another, etc. Almost
none of this functionality exists yet, but I have plans.

It's my latest in a series of occasional experiments in web development.

Cheers,\
Alan
